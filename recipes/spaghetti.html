        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the type of pasta dinner recipe you can easily have 
            at the ready thanks to a simply stocked pantry and a few 
            foundation refrigerator ingredients I can always find at my 
            local <strong>Smith's Marketplace / Kroger store</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dice Tomatoes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tomato Paste</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Beef Broth</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Canned Mushrooms</strong></li>
            <li><strong>A splash of wine</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Onion, celery and fresh garlic</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dried Herbs, Kosher Salt, and Freshly Ground Black
                and a Pinch of Sugar for Sweetness.
            </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dried Whole Cloves!</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the Beef:</strong> Drain off any excess fat, then, 
                throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until 
                the vegetables soften.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil and Simmer:</strong> Dump the rest of the 
                homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the 
                mixture to a boil. Once the spaghetti sauce is boiling, 
                reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. 
                I know 3 hours sounds like forever, but that's how long it 
                takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce. Just do what the 
                Italians do, (fuhgetaboutit).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Your Noodles:</strong> Once the homemade 
                spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that's left to 
                do is boiling the spaghetti noodles according to package 
                instructions and dish it up!</li>
        </ol>
