# odin-recipes

The goal of this project is to create a basic html website
to demonstrate the progress of my learning in the Odin Project.
This website will have a main index page that will contain links
to a few recipes. It will not be very pretty.. YET!

By the end of this lesson/project, I hope to be able to he comfortable
with the basics of html and setting up a webpage.
