        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oven baked salmon is a healthy and yummy example of how you can
            cook salmon. Salmon fillets are top with a blend of italian 
            seasoning and black pepper to create a crisp crust that will
            make your mouth water. The plus side of baking salmon is that it
            is quick and easy.

            <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 400 degrees and 
            <em>grease a large baking pan</em>. <strong>Arrange</strong>
            the salmon fillets on the baking sheet and season generously
            with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li><strong>Stir</strong> together the olive oil, garlic, herbs,
            and juice pf 1/2 of the lemon. <strong>Spoon</strong> this
            sauce over salmon fillets, being sure to rub all over the tops
            and sides of the salmon so it has no dry spots. <em>Thinly slice
            the remaining 1/2 of the lemon and top each piece of salmon with
            a slice of lemon.</em></li>

            <li><strong>Bake</strong> the salmon in the oven for 15-18 minutes
            or until the salmon is opaque and flaky when pulled apart with a
            fork. <em>You can broil the last 1-2 minutes if desired.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Garnish</strong> with fresh thyme or parsley 
            <em>if desired</em> and serve.</li>
