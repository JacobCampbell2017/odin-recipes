        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><strong>Have you heard of sushi bake?</strong> It's a super popular potluck dish 
            inspired by sushi. Essentially it's a deconstructed California 
            roll, layered and baked in a casserole. Everything gets warm and 
            creamy and you scoop it up into crispy sheets of roasted seaweed 
            and top it off with cucumber and avocado. It's SO good. If you 
            love California rolls, you'll love sushi bake. It's savory, 
            creamy, and super satisfying.
